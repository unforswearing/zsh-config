- Replace shell oneliners with `ruby` scripts
    - eg. Convert things like long pipes `awk <options> | grep <options> | sed <options> | <etc>`
      or fragile / crappy processes (anything using shell arrays).
- Serialize more than shell functions
- Write an alternate, personal-use version of `aliaser` in `ruby`?
- What more can I do with `nushell`?
