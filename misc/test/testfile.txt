This is a file to test transclusion using micro editor `textfilter`.

First, we add some text before the transclusion to see if the command modifies the content of the file. These two sentences are probably good enough.

Next we use the section below this line to transclude a section of text from another file. This file is called "testtransclude.txt". Move the cursor to the next empty line and use the ctrl-r in micro to run `textfilter cat testtransclude.txt`

this is some content transcluded from 'testtransclude.txt
all done.

It worked.

Lets try again with the new `transclude` command:

this is some content transcluded from 'testtransclude.txt
all done.

it wored again. Hooray.

Lets try something else

/usr/local/bin/bash
/bin/zsh
/usr/local/bin/micro
