# Zsh Config

Somewhat complicated `zsh` configuration scripts. The overall size of the usable 
configuration in this repository is actively shrinking. See [Archive](/archive/)
for a full history of settings, scripts, and dsl experiments which ultimately 
went unused. 

- See [WORKFLOW.md](/WORKFLOW.md) to understand how this configuration is used.
- See [LOG.md](/LOG.md) for "rationale".
